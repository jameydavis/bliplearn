# Bliplearn

**Written during Cedar Falls Startup Weekend 2014 #SWCF14**

Bliplearn is a Ruby on Rails app that allows the user to learn a new skill using "quizes" and short videos called **blips**. The idea behind Bliplearn is to give the user the test first so they are able to move through the content that they already know and focus in on the things that they do not know. How Bliplearn does this is by providing short clips called **blips** for each of the questions. These **blips** will provide information to the user so they can answer the question. This solves the problem of the user having to go back through the lecture video to try and answer that one question, taking a majority of their time as they may have to navigate through a 20 or 30 minute video.
